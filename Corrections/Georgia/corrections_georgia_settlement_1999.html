Venue over any action that might be filed would be in the Middle District of Georgia pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391 (b). </p><p>3. Jurisdiction in the federal court would be pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345. </p><p><b>II. DEFINITIONS</b> </p><p>4. Party of the first part shall refer to the United States of America, which hereinafter shall be referred to as the United States. </p><p>5. Parties of the second part shall refer to Muscogee County, Georgia; the Sheriff of Muscogee County, in his official capacity; the Mayor of Columbus, in his official capacity; the Columbus City Manager, in his official capacity; members of the Columbus Council, in their official capacities; and their agents and successors in office. The City of Columbus and Muscogee County are a consolidated government, and parties of the second part are hereinafter referred to as the City/County. This Agreement is between the United States and the City/County. </p><p>6. The term "Muscogee County Jail" (Jail) includes the three existing Jail facilities (the "new jail," the "old jail," and the "stockade") as well as any other Muscogee County institutions built, leased, or otherwise used, to replace the current Jail or Jail components. </p><p>7. The terms "inmate" or "inmates" shall refer to one or more individuals sentenced to, incarcerated in, detained at, or otherwise confined at either the existing Muscogee County Jail or any institution that is built or used to replace the Jail or any part of the Jail.

BACKGROUND</b> </p><p>9. The City/County owns and operates the Jail, located in Columbus, Georgia. </p><p>10. The Sheriff is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the Jail. In his official capacity, the Sheriff has the custody, rule, and charge of the Jail and Jail inmates. </p><p>11. On December 1, 1994, United States Department of Justice attorneys and their consultants in the fields of penology, correctional health care, and environmental health and safety, toured the Jail pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act. 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1997 <u>et seq.</u> </p><p>12. On June 1, 1995, the United States issued a findings letter regarding conditions of confinement at the Jail based upon the Justice Department investigation and expert tour of the facility. The United States' findings letter was sent to the City/County. This Document detailed numerous alleged constitutional deficiencies allegedly affecting the life, health, and safety of Muscogee County inmates. </p><p>13. The parties to this Agreement recognize the constitutional rights of inmates confined in the Jail. These rights include, but are not limited to, the right to: (1) adequate supervision to ensure reasonable inmate safety, (2) adequate medical and mental health care, (3) a safe and sanitary physical plant which does not pose an unreasonable threat to safety, (4) reasonable opportunity for exercise, and (5) meaningful access to the courts. </p><p>14. In order to avoid protracted litigation regarding the constitutionality of conditions of confinement at the Jail, the parties agree to the provisions set forth in this Agreement. </p><p>15.

Any housing used for inmates must meet the requirements of this agreement and constitutional standards, and the United States shall have reasonable inspection rights for any facilities used as allowed by this agreement.  </p><p><br>17. In ensuring City/County compliance with this section on overall jail conditions, City/County officials shall require that construction and renovations be conducted in compliance with the National Fire Protection Association's Life Safety Code, state and local building codes, American Correctional Association (ACA) standards, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and ADA regulations. </p><p>18.

For purposes of this agreement only and in order to settle this matter, the City/County stipulates that this agreement complies in all respects with the provisions of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3626(a). The parties further stipulate and agree that the prospective relief in this agreement is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violations of federal rights alleged by the United States, is the least intrusive means necessary to correct these violations, and will not have an adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system. Accordingly, the parties agree and represent that the agreement complies in all respects with the provisions of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3626(a). </p><p>71. The issue of liability has not been litigated. </p><p>72. This agreement is not intended to have any preclusive effect except between the parties.

Once the City/County has determined that the termination requirements of paragraphs 73-74 have been met, the City/County shall advise the United States of its determination in writing. Thereafter, the parties anticipate a period of consultation, evaluation, and conferral. If the parties concur that the final termination requirements have been met, the parties anticipate filing a Joint Motion for Final Dismissal of this action.

Once such a unilateral Motion is filed, a hearing shall be held to evaluate whether the conditions for final dismissal identified in paragraphs 73-74 (above) have been met. Nothing in this Agreement precludes the parties from jointly stipulating to termination of portions of this Agreement at any time. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br></p> <p><b>FINDING PURSUANT TO THE PRISON LITIGATION REFORM ACT</b></p>  <p>   <br>   <br> </p><p>Having considered the foregoing Agreement, and the associated Joint Motion for Conditional Dismissal and Order of Conditional Dismissal, and based on the stipulation of the parties, the Court hereby finds: </p><p>1.&nbsp; The prospective relief in the Agreement is necessary to correct the violations of the federal rights of Muscogee County Jail inmates alleged by the United States. </p><p>2.&nbsp; The Agreement is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct these violations, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct these violations. </p><p>3.&nbsp; The Agreement will not have an adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system. </p><p>4.
